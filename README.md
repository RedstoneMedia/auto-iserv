# Auto Iserv v.0.1.3

This is a library for python, that can be used to create tools to automate Iserv **without** an API key
The only thing that is needed is a Iserv account with a username and password.
It is recommended to use a credential file, but you can hardcode your password and username.
This can be done by typing : `gen-iserv-credential`

There are pre written Modules, but you can also create your own module automation.
